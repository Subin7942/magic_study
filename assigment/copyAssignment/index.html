        We make Live, Push, Note, Move and Link - unique software and hardware
        for music creation and performance. With these products, our community
        of users creates amazing things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ableton was founded in 1999 and released the first version of Live in
        2001. Our products are used by a community of dedicated musicians, sound
        designers, and artists from across the world.

        Making music isn’t easy. It takes time, effort, and learning. But when
        you’re in the flow, it’s incredibly rewarding.
      </p>
      <p>
        We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force
        behind Ableton is our passion for what we make, and the people we make
        it for.

        We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided between
        our headquarters in Berlin and our offices in Los Angeles and Tokyo.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use
        Live and Push every day. We come from a wide range of cultural and
        professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught,
        and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared
        belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to
        something big: helping to shape the future of music culture.

        Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our
        people what they need to work their magic and grow. We’ve learned that
        achieving the best results comes from building teams that are richly
        diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of
        perspectives. We don’t always agree with each other, but opinion and
        debate are valued and openly encouraged.

        We work hard to foster an environment where people can grow both
        personally and professionally, and we strive to create a wealth of
        opportunities to learn from and with each other.

        Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported
        in acquiring new knowledge and skills, and coached on applying these in
        their daily work. In addition, staff-organized development and music
        salons are a chance to discuss new technologies, production techniques
        and best practices.

        exceptional talent from around the world, we will do everything we can

        If you're joining us in Berlin, we'll help with relocation and
        paperwork. We’ll even provide you with free German or English lessons.
        Plus, working in Germany means you can expect comprehensive health
        insurance for you and your family, as well as generous maternity and
        paternity leave. Office hours are flexible, but it’s not all work; we
        have several company and team outings throughout the year as well as a
        variety of fun, informal small-group activities.
